The "Analytic Tracking Items" hold planned amounts, and track their WIP and variances.
These can be automatically created by logic in other modules,
but with this module alone the creation needs to be done manually:

* Navigate to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration
  > Analytic Accounting > Analytic Tracking Items*.

* Create an Analytic Tracking Item:

  * Set the Analytic Account.

  * Set the Product, use one that has a non-zero cost
    and belongs to a category with the "Costing" section configured.

  * Set the Planned Amount.


Analytic Items are used to record the actual costs:

* Navigate to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration
  > Analytic Accounting > Analytic Items*.

* Create an Analytic Item:

  * Set the Analytic Account, Description and Date.

  * Set the Product, use one that has a non-zero cost
    and belongs to a category with the "Costing" section configured.

  * Set the quantity consumed.

  * The Amount field should be automatically computed, with a negative amount.


Analytic Tracking Items are used to follow the costs incurred
and the comparison with the planned amounts. This can be used for analysis:

* Navigate to ''Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration > Analytic Accounting > Analytic Tracking Items''

* The list presents lines being tracked, and displays columns with Actual Amount,
  Expected Amount, WIP Amount, Variance Amount, etc.


WIP and variances journal entries are generated by a scheduled job:

* Navigate to *Setting > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions*.

* Locate and open the *Account: Process WIP and Variances* record, and click on the RUN MANUALLY button.

* Check the generated journal entries, at *Accounting > Miscellaneous > Journal Entries*.
